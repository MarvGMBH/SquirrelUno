API Documentation
=================

Welcome to the API documentation for the SquirrelUno project. This section provides a comprehensive guide to the project's codebase, detailing each class and method to help you understand and use them effectively. Whether you're contributing to the project or looking to extend its functionality, this documentation is designed to support your development needs.

Overview
========

The SquirrelUno project is structured to facilitate easy understanding and extension. The core functionality is divided across several modules, each responsible for different aspects of the game. This documentation covers the primary entry points and key components of the project.

Console Entry Point
===================

The console entry point, defined in `__main__.py`, handles the command-line interface (CLI) for SquirrelUno. This module allows users to interact with the game through various commands and options.

.. automodule:: uno.__main__
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

Script Entry
============

The script entry point, defined in `__init__.py`, initializes the SquirrelUno package and contains the main logic for starting the game. This module ensures that all necessary components are correctly set up and ready to use.

.. automodule:: uno
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

Using This Documentation
========================

Each module's documentation includes a detailed list of members (functions, classes, methods) and their descriptions. Inheritance diagrams are provided where applicable to illustrate the class hierarchy and relationships.

Key sections:
- **Members**: Lists all public members of the module.
- **Undocumented Members**: Highlights any members without documentation, encouraging contributions to improve coverage.
- **Inheritance**: Shows the inheritance structure of classes, helping you understand the architecture of the project.
