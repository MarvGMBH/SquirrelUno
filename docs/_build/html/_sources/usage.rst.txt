Usage
=====

### Running the Project

After installing the package, you can run the main entry point. The command differs slightly between Linux and Windows due to how Python handles module names and entry points on different operating systems.

#### On Linux

You can run the project using either of the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   squirreluno

or

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m uno

#### On Windows

On Windows, due to certain constraints, you should use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m uno

(Note: The `squirreluno` command may not work on Windows due to differences in how Python handles entry points and module names across platforms.)

### What You'll See

When you run the project, you should see the following output:

.. code-block:: plaintext
